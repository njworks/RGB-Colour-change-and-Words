# RGB-Colour-change-and-Words
Change text colour through given RGB values and store words

Ex1: <br />
A colour may be specified by its RGB value. Allows the user to specify RGB values in three text fields, and, when a button is pressed,
displays in the chosen colour. If, when the button is pressed, the content of any of the text fields
is not an integer, the invalid field(s) should be cleared and an
appropriate message should appear on the centre panel. <br />
If any of the text fields contains a value less than 0, the value 200
should be used in its place when generating the colour – the
displayed value in the text field should also be changed to 200.
Similarly, if any of the fields contains a number greater than 255,
the value 255 should be used and displayed.  
<br />
A “Reset” button at the top of the application which, if
pressed, will result in all text fields being emptied and the initial
welcome message being displayed. 
<br />
 <br />
Ex2: <br />
Application allows the user to store a list of words. 
allow the user to  <br />
 add a word to the list (the word to be added is provided in a text
field at the bottom of the application).  <br />
 display all of the words from the list that begin with a specified
letter (this method should be case-insensitive, e,g, no matter
whether the user input is 'A' or ‘a’, all words beginning with 'a'
should be displayed)  <br />
 search the list for a word (that is provided in the text field) and
display how many times it is found; if however the text field is
empty when this button is pressed, then the system should display
the total number of all words in the list (together with an
appropriate message)  <br />
 remove from the list the first occurrence of a word  <br />
 remove from the list all occurrences of a word  <br />
 clear the list  <br />
The list may contain duplicate entries. Words may contain only letters
and hyphens (-) and must begin with a letter.
For each action specified above an appropriate message should be
displayed on the centre panel confirming the action, e.g.
“Word ‘toast’ has been added to the list”.
An appropriate error message should be displayed if any of the actions
failed, e.g.
“The string ‘12’ was not added to the list as it is not a valid word.”
